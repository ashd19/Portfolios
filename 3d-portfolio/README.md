1] This was not meant to be public or shared , but if u  have this code things to note..
 - This repo has *bad structure of files / folders * etc so beware if you are going to change the ui elements, etc .
 - If you only want to change the data go to constants/index.ts 
   ** Note its a ts file not the equivalent js file , I need to delete it . 
  So now , just change the date and you should be good .
